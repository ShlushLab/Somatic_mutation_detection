This repository contains an R script for processing and filtering genomic variant data generated by Mutect2
Variant Filtering Pipeline
This repository contains an R script for processing and filtering genomic variant data generated during bioinformatics analyses. The script integrates seamlessly into workflows involving variant calling, annotation, and downstream filtering.

## Key Features
Preprocessing Overview: Supports variant calling data generated by Mutect2 (GATK v4.1.7.0) in 'tumor-only' mode, following GATK Best Practices.
Resource Integration: Incorporates population germline references from gnomAD and 1000 Genomes Project to filter germline variants effectively.
Annotation-Compatible: Takes annotated variant files from ANNOVAR as input.
Filtering: Filters variants based on defined criteria.
Output: Generates a clean, high-quality variant dataset for further analysis.
## Repository Contents
variant_filtering.R: The main R script for variant filtering and preprocessing.

## Prerequisites
Tools and Libraries:
R v4.0+ with dplyr and other required packages installed.
Preprocessed variant files annotated using ANNOVAR.
Genomic Resources:
gnomAD and 1000 Genomes Project reference
